## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

This project is an interactive slide presentation built with
[marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo),
an open-source Python notebook that's reproducible,
shareable as an app, and executable as a script.
The presentation demonstrates various features of marimo, including:

- Interactive UI elements (sliders)
- Dynamic mathematical formulas
- Responsive data visualizations
- Interactive charts with data selection capabilities

The presentation serves as both a demo of marimo's capabilities and a
template for creating your own interactive presentations.
